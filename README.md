yii-ext-hetznersms
==================

SMS sending through the SMS gateway present on hetzner.de hosting accounts.

The API is designed to allow the component to be used as a drop-in replacement
for the BulkSMS-based sending component initially developed by Alexander
Emelyanov.

I am in no way affiliated with hetzner.de, and this component is not
officially supported by hetzner.de. It merely implements the gateway as
described in their documentation:
